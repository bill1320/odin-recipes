		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Slow Cooker Crack Chicken has everything that is good and 
			addicting in it! Filled with bacon, cheese, cream cheese, and

			in it!
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
			<li>1 oz. packet ranch seasoning mix</li>
			<li>16 oz. cream cheese</li>
			<li>8 slices bacon</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>1/2 cup sliced green onions</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Add the chicken thighs to the slow cooker. Sprinkle over 
				the ranch seasoning mix. Place the cream cheese on top of 
				the chicken.</li>
			<li>Cover and cook on LOW for 7 hours without opening the lid 
				during the cooking time.</li>
			<li>Shred the chicken, I do this right in the slow cooker with 
				2 forks. Stir the cooked cream cheese into the shredded 
				chicken and also stir in the bacon. Spread out into an even 
				layer. Sprinkle over the cheese. Cover for 10 more minutes 
				to allow the cheddar cheese to melt.</li>
			<li>Serve over rice and sprinkle over the green onions. Enjoy! 
				Other great ways to serve is over a baked potato or on 
				sandwich rolls. </li>
		</ol>
