	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Slow Cooker Chili is one of my all time most popular recipes, 
		come fall and winter thousands of people make it every day! And 
		for good reason, this is the best crockpot chili around! It's 
		incredibly flavorful, it's packed with protein and perfectly 
		hearty, plus it's a dinner everyone can agree on.</p>
