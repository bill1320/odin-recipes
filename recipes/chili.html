	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Slow Cooker Chili is one of my all time most popular recipes, 
		come fall and winter thousands of people make it every day! And 
		for good reason, this is the best crockpot chili around! It's 
		incredibly flavorful, it's packed with protein and perfectly 
		hearty, plus it's a dinner everyone can agree on.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
		<li>2 lbs lean ground beef</li>
		<li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
		<li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
		<li>2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies</li>
		<li>3 (8 oz) cans tomato sauce</li>
		<li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp chili powder</li>
		<li>2 1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
		<li>2 tsp paprika</li>
		<li>2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
		<li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp ground coriander</li>
		<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
		<li>1 (15 oz) can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
		<li>1 (15 oz) can light red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
		<li>Shredded cheddar cheese, for serving</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat olive oil in a large and deep non-stick skillet over 
			medium-high heat. </li>
		<li>Add onion and saute 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute 30 
			seconds longer. Pour onions into a 6 or 7 quart slow cooker.</li>
		<li>Return skillet to medium-high eat, add beef and cook 
			stirring occasionally until beef has browned.</li>
		<li>Drain most of fat from beef, leaving about 2 Tbsp in with 
			beef (this is optional, I think it ads flavor but you can 
			drain it all if you'd prefer). Pour browned beef into slow 
			cooker.</li>
		<li>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef broth, chili 
			powder, cumin, paprika, cocoa powder, sugar, coriander and 
			season mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
		<li>Cover with lid and cook on low heat for 5 - 6 hours.</li>
		<li>Stir in dark and light red kidney beans and allow to heat 
			through, about 2 minutes. Serve warm with desired toppings.</li>
	</ol>
